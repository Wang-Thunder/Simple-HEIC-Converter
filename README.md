Simple HEIC Converter is a lightweight program that allows you to convert heic images to jpg images. You can select either individual files, or an entire directory as the source.

Select Browse in the JPG Output Directory row to select an output destination for the converted files. If no output directory is selected then SHC will use the source directory as the output. 

Selecting "Delete Original HEIC Image" will delete the HEIC image and leave only the converted JPG in its place. 

Selecting "Output to a unique folder" will generate a date/time stamped folder in the output directory with the converted files. 

The console should display the status of your conversion or any errors that pop up. 

Most elements have tooltips when you hover that will explain what it does :)
